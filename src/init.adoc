== Status

Accepted

== Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to capture why certain decisions were made,
and what considerations went into those decisions.

These may be very technical in nature, or decisions that are significant in the context of other stakeholders 
that the architecture is impacted by.

== Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[described by Michael Nygard].

== Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools].
